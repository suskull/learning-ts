# Exercise 01: Basic Setup & Types

## Scenario
You have a legacy JavaScript function that calculates the total price of items in a cart. It's prone to bugs because there's no type safety. Your task is to convert it to TypeScript.

## Instructions
1.  Rename `index.js` to `index.ts`.
2.  Add type annotations to the function parameters and return type.
3.  Define an interface for the `CartItem`.
4.  Fix any type errors that appear.

## Run
To compile and run:
```bash
npx tsc index.ts
node index.js
```
